# 🚀 Organizational Automation & Governance System

**A unified backend for orchestrating roles, workflows, policies, tasks, and infrastructure for AI-driven organizations.**
Modular, policy-aware, and designed for secure, scalable, and autonomous operations in modern cloud-native environments.

### Project Status 🚧

* **Alpha**: This project is in active development and subject to rapid change. ⚠️
* **Testing Phase**: Features are experimental; expect bugs, incomplete functionality, and breaking changes. 🧪
* **Not Production-Ready**: We **do not recommend using this in production** (or relying on it) right now. ⛔

## 💡 Why Use This?

| Problem                                               | Our Solution                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔹 Fragmented org, role, and policy systems           | Unified control layer for access, validation, and execution |
| 🔹 Manual org provisioning and scaling                | Automated provisioning + dynamic autoscaler per org         |
| 🔹 Workflow sprawl and uncontrolled function use      | DSL-governed workflows with role-based execution rights     |
| 🔹 Inefficient job allocation across agents           | Constraint-evaluated assignment engine with queue fallback  |
| 🔹 Lack of observability into function/tool execution | WebSocket and Redis tracking for every execution lifecycle  |
