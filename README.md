# 🚀 Organizational Automation & Governance System

**A unified backend for orchestrating roles, workflows, policies, tasks, and infrastructure for AI-driven organizations.**
Modular, policy-aware, and designed for secure, scalable, and autonomous operations in modern cloud-native environments.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

### 🧩 Modular Organization Lifecycle

* 🏢 Define and provision organizations via declarative metadata
* 🔁 Automate creation of org-specific resources and service deployments
* 📇 Register, search, and manage orgs via GraphQL and REST APIs
* ⚙️ Enable dynamic org-level autoscaling and resource enforcement

### 🔐 Secure Role and Access Management

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Associate users with roles, job spaces, and function access
* ✅ Enforce access control using constraint-based DSLs
* 🔄 Dynamically resolve permissions during request lifecycle
* 📜 Track all associations, constraints, and contracts in MongoDB

### 🛠 Workflow-Driven Execution Engine

* 🧠 Execute modular workflows using tools, functions, and DAGs
* 🔄 Route jobs to internal agents based on org-specific logic
* 🪢 Delegate node-level execution via APIs or local executors
* 📦 Queue-based execution and WebSocket updates

### 🔍 Comprehensive Governance & Observability

* 🛡 Enforce constraint checks before tool/function invocation
* 📈 Monitor org usage, apply quotas, and trigger autoscaling
* 📬 Message validation and execution via NATS or Redis queues
* 📘 Fully observable with logs, metrics, and live execution traces

## 💡 Why Use This?

| Problem                                               | Our Solution                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔹 Fragmented org, role, and policy systems           | Unified control layer for access, validation, and execution |
| 🔹 Manual org provisioning and scaling                | Automated provisioning + dynamic autoscaler per org         |
| 🔹 Workflow sprawl and uncontrolled function use      | DSL-governed workflows with role-based execution rights     |
| 🔹 Inefficient job allocation across agents           | Constraint-evaluated assignment engine with queue fallback  |
| 🔹 Lack of observability into function/tool execution | WebSocket and Redis tracking for every execution lifecycle  |
